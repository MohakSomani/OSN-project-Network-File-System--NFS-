Naming Server employees MutliThreading to create Seperate threads to handle Clients as well as 
Storage Servers which are selected from Thread pool of fixed size(to improve performance)

Both Client Accpetor and Storage Server Accpetor are running on different ports and are running
dynamically so that mutiple clients and storage servers can join it at any time. These threads
accept incoming connections and create new threads to handle them.

Client Handler thread provides an abstraction to handle all the requests from a client and 
sends back the apt response to the client. The request are preprocessed and then stashed in 
a global request array. The request array has a maximum size to prevent congestion. The request
array is a blocking queue and hence the client handler thread will wait if the request array is
full. 

The request array is processed by the main thread which is the Naming Server thread. The Naming
Server thread will process the request array and send the request to the appropriate storage
server. The Naming Server thread will also send the response back to the client.
